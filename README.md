This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It's a simple app to play around with creating an app with "dark mode".  It will read your browser's setting and display light or dark mode as appropriate.  You can also override the setting with the toggle switch and this will save your preference in local storage so it will persist over page refreshes and future visits.  

One thing I like about the CRA boostrapped app is that it is fully fluid. Even the font size smoothly adjusts to the viewport size.  You can see when resizing the browser.  That way it fits any screen size.  

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
